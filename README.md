## Just checking the TALL stack

Just a small subscribe landing page with a super small dashboard to check TALL stack. TALL stack is a web stack for Laravel developers that focuses on the following technologies: Tailwind CSS for the design , Alpine.js for the interactivity (A much simpler version of React / Vue but still powerfull), Livewire that communicates the front end to the back end via AJAX without writing any JavaScript and ofcourse Laravel framework, the core component of all these!

This STACK seems very powerfull to me & can save ton of development time.


## I'm shocked! That was great & as a backend developer I loved that.

I really loved that web stack because me, as not huge fan of JavaScript it really made things much easier. This can save ton of time! Wow..
